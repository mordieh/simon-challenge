Simon Game
A fun and interactive memory game where the player must repeat a pattern of flashing lights and sounds.

How to Play
The game will start by showing a sequence of flashing colors.

Repeat the sequence by clicking the same colors in the same order.

If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game will add one more color to the sequence.

The game gets progressively harder as the sequence increases.
